                        Hi, I'm Ella, I am a zoology graduate turned retail
                        manager turned software engineer! As winding as the path
                        may seem, in reality I've just spent the last few years
                        solving an array of different problem types and they
                        have each lead me to coding. I am finding my
                        adaptability, issue resolution skills and scientific
                        approach are all coming in useful as I learn a whole new
                        way of interacting with technology. <br />
                        <br />When I'm not up late learning javascript you might
                        find me running through puddles, shooting a netball in a
                        hoop or counting stitches on a crochet project &#x1F5F2;

                        Despite being a career changer and not having prior
                        coding experience, in my time with _nology I have
                        developed proficiency in each of the languages and areas
                        below. Now that the course has finised I am continuing
                        to sharpen my skills in each areas, as well as taking on
                        new challenges like React. Keep an eye on my GitHub
                        repository to see my progress! (linked at the bottom of
                        my portfolio).

                        Throughout the _nology training course, at every stage I
                        have been encouraged to test and stretch my knowledge by
                        actually building projects from the ground up. Here you
