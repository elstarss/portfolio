# Web Project - Portfolio

---

<!-- _class: no-background-image -->

## Overview

-   Create a personal portfolio using one of the two designs on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/GcXrhyHfbBVzSsRHPcTmRh/Curriculum---Web---Student-Portfolio-Template?node-id=3552%3A2)
    as a template and deploy it using github pages.
-   The designs are plain black and white, but you should choose a colour scheme and your own font pairings to use! (The pages to look at are "Template 1" and "Template 2" firstly to choose your style. Then look at "Template 1 examples" in order to see how different colour schemes / themes could work).
